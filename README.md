# Intel Image Classification Dataset

## Introduction

The Intel Image Classification Dataset project aims to build a machine learning model for image classification using the Intel Image Classification dataset. The model is developed to achieve an accuracy of over 95% in classifying images from different layers of the earth such as forest, mountain, sea, street, glacier, and building. Notably, this model has a parameter count of only 279,590, showcasing resource efficiency.

## Data

The Intel Image Classification Dataset is a diverse collection of images showcasing various layers of the earth's landscape. The dataset includes 6 main classes:
- Forest
- Mountain
- Sea
- Street
- Glacier
- Building

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or other deep learning libraries)
- Other required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mthanhlm/Project/blob/main/intel-image-classification-dataset.ipynb
ipython intel-image-classification-dataset.ipynb.ipynb

## Result

The model has achieved an accuracy of over 95% in classifying images from different layers of the earth. Notably, the model utilizes only 279,590 parameters, demonstrating lightweight and efficient resource usage.
